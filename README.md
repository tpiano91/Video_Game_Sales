# Video Game Sales
###### This project was completed as a requirement for the Data Analytics Program by CareerFoundry

## Project Overview

#### You’re an analyst for a new video game company, GameCo, which wants to use data to inform the development of new games. As such, you’ve been asked to perform a descriptive analysis of a video game data set to foster a better understanding of how GameCo’s new games might fare in the market.

## Key Questions
#### GameCo executives are open to hearing any insights you can pull from the data but are specifically interested in these questions:
##### ● Are certain types of games more popular than others?
##### ● What other publishers will likely be the main competitors in certain markets?
##### ● Have any games decreased or increased in popularity over time?
##### ● How have their sales figures varied between geographic regions over time?

## Context

#### As a professional data analyst, it’s essential that you’re able to understand a problem, map it onto a type of analysis, use data to confirm a hypothesis, and communicate any insights back to the client. Producing an end-to-end analysis will allow you to present the work you’ve done while displaying your hands-on technical skills.
#### Most analyses these days are done using computer software, which is exactly what you’ll focus on throughout this course, developing the behind-the-scenes technical skills that form the core of any good analysis. While your project will involve data from a specific domain, the individual Tasks could be applied to any domain and will highlight your aptitude as a problem solver for a variety of clients.
#### The goal here is for the individual Tasks to help you work incrementally towards your final analysis. As well as helping break your final project into more manageable chunks, the Exercises are designed to introduce you to the ins and outs of the data analyst’s workflow.
#### The target audience/key stakeholders are GameCo's executives, including the following:
##### ● Vice President of Marketing
##### ● Chief Financial Officer
##### ● Senior Vice President of Sales

## Data

#### This data was drawn from the website VGChartz.

#### Important points regarding the data set:
##### ● It tracks the total number of units of games sold (not financial figures) from 1980 to 2016.
##### ● The numbers represent units sold in millions. When you see the number “1.2,” for instance, this represents a total of 1.2 million units sold.
